# Supervised-Classification
ðŸ”¹ Supervised Classification Project

### 1. Objective

The goal was to build a machine learning model that can classify flowers into categories (e.g., Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.
This is a Supervised Learning problem because:

You had labeled data (features + species labels).

You trained the model to learn the mapping from input â†’ output.

### 2. Dataset - 

You used an Iris-like dataset with these features:

SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm

Target (label): Species ( Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica )

If your dataset was only features (no labels), you first generated predictions and added them back as a new column.
